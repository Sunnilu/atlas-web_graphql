GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.  GraphQL provides a complete and nderstandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

GraphQL quieries always return predictable results.  Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get not the server.

GraphQL queries access not ust the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them.  While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, Graph QL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.  Apps usng GraphQL can be quick even in slow mobile network connections.

GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints.  Access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint.  GraphQL uses types to ensure Apps only ask for what's possible and provide clear and helpful errors.  Apps can use tyes to avoid writing manual parsing code.
